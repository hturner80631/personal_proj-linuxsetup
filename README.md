# personal_proj-linuxsetup
Various projects that I am doing for fun/education purposes.
There are scripts on this project that have been depreciated since the underlying assets seem to have changed.
I am currently working on a fix for these.

The Linux setup projects are projects that are supposed to be used in a Linux first time setup environment. 
I created a python script because I am not that great at creating bash scripts and I have taken a class on Python.
I have added various utilities that should be installed and also have added portions that are specific for ARM processors.
The portions that are reserved for ARM processors and might need to be commented out before you go through and run the script.
